Grievances (DARPG), a call book is required to be maintained by a Department in 
which a case, which had reached a stage where no action could, or needed to be 
taken to expedite its disposal for at least 6 months (e.g. cases held up in the law 
courts), could be transferred with the approval of a competent authority. Cases 
transferred to the call book are not included in the monthly statement of pending
